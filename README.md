# [CNN]-[GTSRB] - Classification of GTSRB Dataset Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This notebook delves into a classification task involving the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the GTSRB dataset.

The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) is a dataset comprising over 50,000 photos of road signs categorized into approximately 40 classes.

A detailed description of the dataset can be found at: [http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset)

We have structured the notebook into two main sections:

# Objectives
This section delineates the specific goals of this notebook, which are:
