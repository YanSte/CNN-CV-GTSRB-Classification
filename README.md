# | CNN | CV | GTSRB - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for Computer Vision (CV) in GTSRB Traffic Sign Classification

This notebook delves into a classification task involving the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the GTSRB dataset.

The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) is a dataset comprising over 50,000 photos of road signs categorized into approximately 40 classes.

A detailed description of the dataset can be found at: [http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset)

We have structured the notebook into two main sections:

# Objectives
This section delineates the specific goals of this notebook, which are:

- Training a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) model to achieve high accuracy in classification of road signs.

# Implementation
This section presents the hands-on steps necessary to attain the previously mentioned objectives. These steps include:

- **Imports, Constants, and Methods:** Setting up the necessary libraries, constants, and methods for our task.
- **Data Retrieval:** Acquiring the GTSRB dataset to be used for training and testing purposes.
- **Data Preparation:** Preprocessing and setting up the dataset to facilitate effective training of the CNN model.
- **Model Creation:** Architecting and constructing the CNN model utilizing Keras.
- **Model Training:** Engaging the CNN model in learning using the prepared dataset.
- **Evaluation:** Gauging the trained model's performance and analyzing the classification results.
